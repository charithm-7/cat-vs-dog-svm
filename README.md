# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project demonstrates the use of **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for classifying images of **cats and dogs** using grayscale images resized to a fixed dimension.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build an image classification model using **SVM** that can accurately distinguish between cat and dog images from the Kaggle dataset.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn (SVM, train_test_split, StandardScaler)
- NumPy & Pandas
- scikit-image (imread, resize)
